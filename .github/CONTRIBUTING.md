# Contributing to Menu Bar for Symfony (GNOME Port)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Menu Bar for Symfony for GNOME! This project is a port of the macOS version, adapted for Linux and GNOME Shell using GJS (GNOME JavaScript).

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful, constructive, and professional in all interactions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/tito10047/menubar-for-symfony/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - GNOME Shell version and Symfony CLI version
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features
1. Check existing issues for similar suggestions
2. Create a new issue with `[Feature Request]` prefix
3. Describe the feature and its use case
4. Explain why it would benefit users

### Pull Requests
1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the code style:
   - Use **TypeScript** (Strict mode).
   - Follow GJS best practices for ESModules.
   - UI must use native GNOME Shell modules (`gi://St`, `gi://Gio`, `gi://GLib`).
   - Preferences UI must use **GTK4** and **Libadwaita**.
3. **Strict TDD (Test-Driven Development)**:
   - For any business logic, you MUST write a failing test in **Jest** before implementing the logic.
4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run test
   npm run test:integration # If you have symfony-cli installed locally
   ```
5. **Commit with clear messages** (in English):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what changed"
   ```
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
   - Reference issues: "Fixes #123".
6. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Fill out the PR template.
   - Link related issues.
   - Add screenshots for UI changes.

## Development Setup

### Requirements
- Linux with **GNOME Shell 45** or newer.
- **Node.js** and **npm**.
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) installed and available in your `PATH`.
- `librsvg` (if you plan to generate/manipulate icons).

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/symfony-cli-menubar.git
cd symfony-cli-menubar

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build

# Compile GSettings schemas (required for settings to work)
npm run compile-schemas

# Install locally for testing
# WARNING: This script will force a logout from your current GNOME session!
./install-local.sh
```

```

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)**: Use mocks for everything. No shell or system calls. These must be fast and environment-independent.
- **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)**: These call the real `symfony` CLI. Run them with `RUN_INTEGRATION=1 npm run test:integration`.
- **Debug Mode (tests)**: To see raw communication with the shell during tests, use `DEBUG=1`.
- **Debug Mode (extension)**: To see verbose extension logs in the system journal, enable the `debug-logging` GSettings key (see [Debug Logging](../README.md#debug-logging) in the README). Errors and warnings are always logged regardless of this setting.

## Code Style Guidelines
1. **Language**:
   - Source code, comments, and commit messages must be in **English**.
   - Communication with the maintainer (issues, PR discussions) can be in **Slovak**.
2. **Naming**:
   - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `SymfonyServerManager`).
   - Functions/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `refreshServers()`).
3. **Refactoring**:
   - If you modify old code, refactor it to modern, modular, and DRY standards.
   - Functions should be small and have a Single Responsibility.
4. **Logging**:
   - Every important operation (process start, parsing, setting changes) must be logged using the `LoggerInterface`.
   - Use `debug()`/`info()` for verbose diagnostic messages (suppressed by default; controlled by the `debug-logging` GSettings key).
   - Use `warn()`/`error()` for issues that should always be visible in the journal.

## Iconography
This project uses standard GNOME symbolic icons. For consistency and inspiration, refer to:
[GNOME 46 Adwaita Icons](https://github.com/StorageB/icons/blob/main/GNOME46Adwaita/icons.md)
